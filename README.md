##Jamie Portolese, GISP
With over 15 years of experience in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and data science, I specialize in geospatial analysis, image processing, and database management. My expertise spans across industries, from environmental monitoring to emergency response, real estate analytics, and 3D modeling.

##Areas of Expertise:
GIS & Remote Sensing: Proficient in ESRI, QGIS, Open Source GIS, and image analysis tools like Pix4D, Google Earth Engine, and ERDAS Imagine.
Programming & Data Science: Extensive experience in SQL, Python, and R for geospatial analysis, machine learning, and database management.
Drone Imagery & Photogrammetry: FAA Certified Drone Pilot with expertise in multispectral imaging, 3D modeling, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).
Disaster Assessment & Emergency Response: Volunteer for FEMA damage assessment projects through the Civil Air Patrol, developing statistical models to detect fire, wind, and flood damage using satellite imagery.
3D Visualization & Advanced Techniques: Working with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting for next-generation 3D modeling applications.
